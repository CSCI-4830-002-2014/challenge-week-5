[Starbucks and McDonalds](http://www.princeton.edu/~ina/infographics/starbucks.html)

## What new knowledge or insight have you gained from this visualization? (6 points)

I learned that McDonalds may have a large presence in the USA, and a relatively small presence in the western European countries, but all those countries combined gives a larger percentage of the company's than the USA. Additionally, McDonalds nearly singlehandedly makes sales worth more than every other fast food chain combined.
With regards to Starbucks, the company exhibited exponential growth over time and develops in the same locations as McDonalds.
