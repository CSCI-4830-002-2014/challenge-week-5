# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?

I'm used to searching through forums and blogs to help figure out issues that may come up. However, these tools are more obscure than what I typically use and have a smaller presence online.  For that reason, I sometimes get stuck on problems for longer than I'd typically expect.

## What new knowledge or insight have you gained from this visualization? (6 points)

Scottland had an extremely high voter turnout for the recent vote for independence, so I was interested to see how the percent of turnout varied across the country.  This graphic is particularly interesting because it shows separate graphs of the percent voter turnout and the percent vote share.  This made me want to compare the two graphs and I observed that there was a positive correlation between the percent of voter turnout and the number of individuals who voted "no".  I wish I knew more about Scottland's politics and demographics to infer why this is the case.

Note:  I believe the changes I made to this code are correct to complete the checkpoint.  However, it appears that my setup is unable to render.  I spent a lot of time trying to fix this, but was unable to.I read through the very limited documentation online, issues from other classmates, and the scrapbook examples. I had some unresolved installation errors when initially using npm to install dependencies, so it may relate to that.
