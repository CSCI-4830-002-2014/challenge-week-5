## What new knowledge or insight have you gained from this visualization? (6 points)
I was not aware that bitcoin downloads are so prominent in Europe. The density of downloads is just as dense in Italy as it is in Florida!

I was also unaware that the Midwest of the United Status is as unpopulated as it is. there were so few downloads in areas like Kansas.
