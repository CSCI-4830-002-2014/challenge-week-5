# What is the most difficult part about this week's challenge?
The template should have been updated when Alex found that bug. I spent time trying to make my graph look the same with different filters when really the question should have read 200 and not 100.

I also had issues with the Vector data type in JS. I was unable to call the mean() function on my data because I had not yet cast it to a Vector. Lesson learned

## What new knowledge or insight have you gained from this visualization? (6 points)
I was not aware that bitcoin downloads are so prominent in Europe. The density of downloads is just as dense in Italy as it is in Florida!

I was also unaware that the Midwest of the United Status is as unpopulated as it is. there were so few downloads in areas like Kansas.
